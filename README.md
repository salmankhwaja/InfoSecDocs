# InfoSecDocs
This project is made for the people who would be the administrators of IIS or who would be securing the Servers. Basically, as Security and Hacking are increasing, their is a pressing need to bring all the manual work at one place and convert that manual work into automated work.  

This repository is one such effort in the same direction.
