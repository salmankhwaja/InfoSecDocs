- The Hostname on which Certificate is to be deployed should be known by cleint.
- The hostname along with domain should be known. That would be FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the Hostname.
- The FQDN would then be given to Certificate Authority (
  - Comodo SSL (Now Sectigo), 
  - Sectigo SSL. 
  - DigiCert SSL. 
  - Symantec SSL. 
  - RapidSSL. 
  - GeoTrust SSL. 
  - Thawte SSL.) 
 along with Certificate Signing Request.
- The Certificate Signing Request has to be generated by the Admin of Server.

- The certificate should not be Self Signed by Organziations, rather it should be bought from Certificate Authorities. 
- 
- The Certificate could be (Domain Validated Certificate, Organization Validated, and Extended Validated). The later two would take longer time, but it's more authentic.

- Please make sure, that the certificate to be bought, should be TLS 1.2 enabled, supporting TLS 1.3 and have at least AES_GCM Algorithm support for the Server Validation
- Once you get the certificate, you would receive a zip file containing (*.pem, *.key and / or *.cert / *.crt along with *.key). Other formats could easily be generated by the combination of the files explained.
- The cleint could also choose to go for Wild Card Certificates, which means, one would keep the domain name constant, and can deploy one certificate to many machines / hostnames. 
It's FQDN is usually *.DomainName.com
